In this project is a ROS-melodic package for the control of a xArm 4 dof and 7 dof.

The first task is trajectory planning of the end effector with only using 3 joints
(q1, q2, q4) by computing the reverse kinematic matrix.

The second task is complete kinematic control using all joints using the Jacobean 
Matrix of the robotic arm.

On the picture below is the movement I want to simulate in gazebo in both tasks:
